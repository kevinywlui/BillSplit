# BillSplit — Architecture

BillSplit is an Android app for splitting restaurant bills. Users add people, photograph a receipt, assign each item to whoever ordered it, optionally add a tip or adjustment, and the app computes each person's exact share and generates Venmo charge links.

---

## User Flow

1. **Home** — manage the guest list; toggle who is on this bill from a saved roster
2. **Camera** — photograph the receipt; the image is sent directly to Claude for extraction
3. **Item Assignment** — review extracted items, fix names/prices, assign each item to people; adjust receipt total and tip
4. **Summary** — see each person's itemized share; send Venmo charge requests
5. **History** — browse and re-open past bills

Navigation uses Jetpack Compose Navigation with slide transitions. All five screens share a single `BillViewModel` instance scoped to the navigation graph.

## Data Model

### `Person`
```
id               UUID string (stable across sessions)
name             display name
venmoUsername    optional; enables Venmo deep link on Summary screen
avatarColorIndex index into a fixed palette for avatar background color
```

### `LineItem`
```
id               UUID string
name             item name as extracted / edited by user
price            full item price (not per-person)
assignedPersonIds list of Person IDs who share this item

shareFor(personId) = price / assignedPersonIds.size   (0 if not assigned)
isAssigned         = assignedPersonIds.isNotEmpty()
```

### `BillSession` (live session, computed properties)
```
people               List<Person>          participants in this bill
items                List<LineItem>        all line items
tax                  Double                from receipt (Claude-extracted)
tip                  Double                from receipt (Claude-extracted)
otherFees            Double                surcharges, delivery, etc.
receiptTotal         Double                total printed on receipt (Claude-extracted)
userTotal            Double?               user override of receipt total (null = use Claude value)
adjustments          Double                user-added flat amount on top (tip entered manually)
restaurantName       String
venmoRequestedPersonIds  Set<String>       tracks who has been charged via Venmo

── computed ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
subtotal             = sum of all item prices
totalFees            = tax + tip + otherFees
effectiveReceiptTotal = userTotal ?: (receiptTotal if > 0 else subtotal+totalFees)
effectiveTotal        = effectiveReceiptTotal + adjustments

finalShares: Map<String, Double>   (lazy — computed once per BillSession instance)
  Each person's share = (their food subtotal / bill subtotal) × effectiveTotal
  Rounded via largest-remainder method so shares sum exactly to effectiveTotal.

foodShareFor(personId)   = sum of item.shareFor(personId) across all items
feeShareFor(personId)    = totalFor(personId) - foodShareFor(personId)
fractionFor(personId)    = foodShareFor(personId) / subtotal
```

### `SavedBill`
A frozen snapshot of a completed session, persisted to history. Contains the same fields as `BillSession` plus `savedAt` (epoch ms) and a pre-computed `finalShares` map. Adjustments are folded into `grandTotal` at save time.

### `ParsedReceipt`
Transient struct returned by `ClaudeReceiptParser`. Same numeric fields as `BillSession` minus session-specific state. The ViewModel maps it into a `BillSession` update immediately after parsing.

---

## Fee / Tip Arithmetic

```
effectiveReceiptTotal  =  userTotal  OR  receiptTotal  OR  subtotal+totalFees

effectiveTotal  =  effectiveReceiptTotal + adjustments
                              ▲
                     user-entered tip (flat $ or % of effectiveReceiptTotal
                     or derived from a user-specified final total)

For each person P:
  foodShare(P)  =  Σ item.shareFor(P)
  total(P)      =  (foodShare(P) / subtotal) × effectiveTotal
```

Rounding: every share is floored to cents; the leftover cents are distributed one at a time to the people with the largest fractional remainders (largest-remainder method). This guarantees `Σ total(P) == effectiveTotal` exactly.

## Receipt Parsing Pipeline

```
Camera bitmap
      │
      ▼
ClaudeReceiptParser.parse(bitmap)
  1. Scale bitmap to ≤ 1568px on longest dimension
  2. JPEG-compress at 85% quality
  3. Base64-encode
  4. POST to https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
       model: claude-sonnet-4-6
       temperature: 0
       content: [image block, text prompt]
  5. Parse JSON from response
      │
      ▼
ParsedReceipt { items, tax, tip, otherFees, receiptTotal, restaurantName }
      │
      ▼
BillViewModel updates BillSession
```

**Prompt rules:**
- Only food/drink items in the `items` array; tax/subtotal/total are not items
- Quantities > 1 are split into individual items at unit price
- Tax, tip, surcharges, delivery → separate fee fields
- `restaurantName` from the top of the receipt

OkHttp timeouts: connect 30s, write 60s, read 60s. The call is wrapped in `suspendCancellableCoroutine` so cancelling the coroutine also cancels the in-flight HTTP request.

## Venmo Deep Link

All link logic lives in `util/VenmoLink.kt` (pure JVM, unit-tested in `VenmoLinkTest`). Venmo usernames are normalized once at save time (`normalizeVenmoUsername`): whitespace, a leading `@`, and pasted profile URLs (`venmo.com/u/<name>` etc.) all reduce to the bare username. Normalization is lenient by design — no charset/length validation — so a valid username can never be rejected.

When a person has a `venmoUsername` and their total > $0, Summary shows a charge button. Tapping it:

1. Builds a note string (`buildVenmoNote`):
   ```
   Pacific Catch: Salmon ($20.95) + Fries ÷2 ($4.00) + Fees/Tip ($7.42=18%) = $32.37
   ```
   - Per-item amounts are each person's actual share (÷N for shared items)
   - Fees/tip shown as dollar amount + percentage of food subtotal
   - Kept under Venmo's ~280-char note cap by degrading in steps that each preserve the arithmetic: itemized → items collapsed to `N items ($X.XX)` → restaurant prefix dropped → hard truncation with `...`

2. Fires `Intent.ACTION_VIEW` with the URL from `buildVenmoChargeUrl`:
   ```
   https://venmo.com/?txn=charge&audience=private
     &recipients=<percent-encoded username>
     &amount=<total>
     &note=<percent-encoded note>
   ```
   Both query params are percent-encoded with `%20` for spaces (never `+`, which some decoders keep literal). The username is re-normalized at link-build time so rosters saved before normalization existed still produce working links.

3. Marks the person as requested in `session.venmoRequestedPersonIds` (shown as a checkmark in the UI).

## Persistence

Both repositories use **Jetpack DataStore** (Preferences), storing JSON strings under a single key. All mutations use atomic `edit { }` blocks — reads happen inside the transaction, not from a cached snapshot.

### `PeopleRepository` (`people` DataStore)
- Key: `people_json`
- Stores the user's saved roster of people across all bills
- Read as a `Flow<List<Person>>`; mutated via `addPerson`, `updatePerson`, `deletePerson`
- `addPerson` computes `avatarColorIndex` from the current list length inside the transaction

### `BillHistoryRepository` (`bill_history` DataStore)
- Key: `bills_json`
- Stores a JSON array of `SavedBill` snapshots, newest first
- `saveBill()` prepends; `deleteBill()` filters by id
- Deserialization uses per-entry `mapNotNull` so a corrupt entry is skipped without wiping other bills

---

## ViewModel

`BillViewModel` (AndroidViewModel) is the single source of truth for the active session and drives all screens.

```
State flows:
  session             StateFlow<BillSession>           active bill being worked on
  isProcessing        StateFlow<Boolean>               true while Claude API call is in flight
  errorMessage        StateFlow<String?>               shown as inline error on ItemAssignment
  saveMessage         StateFlow<String?>               shown as snackbar on Summary
  savedPeople         from PeopleRepository.people
  billHistory         from BillHistoryRepository.bills

Key mutations:
  processReceiptImage(bitmap)     → cancels previous job, calls ClaudeReceiptParser, updates session
  assignItem(itemId, personIds)   → updates item.assignedPersonIds
  addLineItem / removeLineItem    → manual item management
  updateLineItemPrice(itemId, $)  → price correction
  setUserTotal($)                 → overrides effectiveReceiptTotal
  setAdjustments($)               → sets tip/adjustment amount
  setRestaurantName(name)
  togglePersonInBill(personId)    → add/remove from session.people
  addNewPerson / updatePerson / deleteSavedPerson  → roster management (all atomic)
  toggleVenmoRequested(personId)
  saveCurrentBill()               → snapshots session → SavedBill → BillHistoryRepository
  loadBillIntoSession(bill)       → restores a SavedBill into session for re-display
  resetSession()                  → clears session and error for a new bill
```
